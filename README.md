# Your Drifing Mind
*an RPG-Maker-inspired game in a StepMania stepchart*

## about
*Your Drifting Mind* is a short narrative game I made in 2018 with the help of
a visual artist and voice actor.  

Working together for 3 months, we crafted a short narrative experience for the
StepMania rhythm game engine that can be described as equal parts "unique" and
"unexpected".

Thank you both so much. ðŸ’›

## history 
The code built on my previous efforts making a tile-based RPG in StepMania from
2015/2016, [UPSRT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzu0ZqADoZg&t=29s).  Both
projects drew heavy inpiration from my past experience with RPG Maker XP and
the online communities that formed around it in the mid-2000s.

*Your Drifting Mind* later appeared as Chapter 19 of *here in the darkness*, a
larger narrative "Easter Egg"  I included in Simply-Love-SM5 from versions 4.8
until [4.9.1](https://github.com/Simply-Love/Simply-Love-SM5/releases/4.9.1).
